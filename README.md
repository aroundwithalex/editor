# Editor: a browser based code editor

This project contains a browser-based code editor, written using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor). It enables a user to write and compile code in 40+ languages, and is inspired from [another project](https://github.com/manuarora700/react-code-editor) with similar aims.
